The dashboard uses NHS prescribing data to show products that have been dispensed within the community, this dashboard will allow the customer to understand how much of their product has been sold over time

•             A line chart showing sales of over time

•             A pie chart showing market share of the each product with the ability to change the time frame

o             MAT the last 12 months  (Moving Annual Total)

o             MQT the last 3 months (Moving Quarterly Total)

o             Month, the last months data only

•             A table showing data by territory over a 12 month period

 

The data it includes, Cash, Quantity and Items which are already calculated, these are the total sales for each product prescribed, no additional calculations are required. Each raw data line shows the total value for the current month by account (GP Practice) and product dispensed per line

 

Cash – the total cash value of the cost to the NHS for the dispensed product

Quantity – This is the total number of products dispensed; however the value could be tablets, ml or grams.  So the label Quantity is used

Items – this is the total number of prescriptions.

 

Moving Totals use the max available period date within the data, ie April 2023, then the previous 11 or 2 months are then included.  When the data is updated monthly, the total will slide to May 2023

 

MAT – Moving Annual Total, 12 months total ie May22 to April23

MQT – Moving Quarterly Total, 3 months total ie Feb23 to April23
